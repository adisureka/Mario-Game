File name LogicList.py  -> the text-game-part

This is the backend part of the file, the program design an object 
and within the object we have a "master_list", master list is a 1d list
however if we use __str__ to  print it out, it will be like

<backend list>
[
   1   2   3   4
   5   6   7   8
   9  10  11  12
  13  14  15  16
                  ]

[
   8   3   2  13
  10   9  12  16
  14   1   6  11
   4  15   7   5
                  ]

No 16 will be the blank tile, only the number around 16 can be switched.

File name puzzle_game.py

This is the GUI file using turtle, the program creates a Control Turtle that does the
following:
1. It creates data structures, including the preceding logicList
2. It listens to the action of the mouse clicking
3. It reads the file and create the dict for the frame

The program uses a turtle dictionary to match the preceding list, one item in the
dictionary will be:

{15: [15, <turtle.Turtle object at 0x7ff4a96107f0>, (-360, 320)]}

In this example, 15 is the preceding list item, and then a turtle object
the third element will be the position of this turtle
The program pastes the pic on each turtle, and each turtle matches an element of the
list, when you move the turtle, the list is changed correspondingly
